  # Change the native redirect uri for client apps
  # When clients register with the following redirect uri, they won't be redirected to any server and the authorization code will be displayed within the provider
  # The value can be any string. Use nil to disable this feature. When disabled, clients must provide a valid URL
  # (Similar behaviour: https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2InstalledApp#choosingredirecturi)
  #
  # native_redirect_uri 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob'

  # Forces the usage of the HTTPS protocol in non-native redirect uris (enabled
  # by default in non-development environments). OAuth2 delegates security in
  # communication to the HTTPS protocol so it is wise to keep this enabled.
  #
  # Callable objects such as proc, lambda, block or any object that responds to
  # #call can be used in order to allow conditional checks (to allow non-SSL

  # Specify what redirect URI's you want to block during creation. Any redirect
  # URI is whitelisted by default.

  # You can use this option in order to forbid URI's with 'javascript' scheme
  # for example.

  # Specify what grant flows are enabled in array of Strings. The valid
  # strings and the flows they enable are:
  #
  # "authorization_code" => Authorization Code Grant Flow
  # "implicit"           => Implicit Grant Flow
  # "password"           => Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Flow
  # "client_credentials" => Client Credentials Grant Flow
  #
  # If not specified, Doorkeeper enables authorization_code and
  # client_credentials.
  #
  # implicit and password grant flows have risks that you should understand
  # before enabling:
  #   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.2
  #   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.3

  # Hook into the strategies' request & response life-cycle in case your
  # application needs advanced customization or logging:
  #
  # before_successful_strategy_response do |request|
  #   puts "BEFORE HOOK FIRED! #{request}"
  # end
  #
  # after_successful_strategy_response do |request, response|
  #   puts "AFTER HOOK FIRED! #{request}, #{response}"
  # end

  # Under some circumstances you might want to have applications auto-approved,
  # so that the user skips the authorization step.
  # For example if dealing with a trusted application.
  # skip_authorization do |resource_owner, client|
  #   client.superapp? or resource_owner.admin?
